This patient has most likely experienced cardiogenic syncope due to ventricular tachycardia (VT); scarring from previous myocardial infarction (evidenced by Q waves on ECG) increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.  Syncope due to VT usually has no warning symptoms (other than palpitations in some patients).  The arrhythmia spontaneously terminates within a few minutes, resulting in restoration of cardiac output and rapid patient recovery with no residual symptoms.
