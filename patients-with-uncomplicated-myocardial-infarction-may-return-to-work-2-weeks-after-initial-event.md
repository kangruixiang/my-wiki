# Patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction may return to work 2 weeks after initial event

<!-- cardiac events, when can go back to work? -->

Most patients with recent **uncomplicated myocardial infarction** (MI) (without recurrent angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure) and **successful revascularization** are at a **low risk of short-term recurrent cardiac events**. As such, they may be encouraged to resume regular activity (eg, work, sexual activity) **2 weeks** after the initial event.

Patients at intermediate risk (eg, stable angina, incomplete revascularization, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) should receive further evaluation with a stress test for risk stratification.

Patient at high risk (eg, unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, severe valvular disease) should be evaluated and stabilized prior to resuming normal  work activity.
