# Cardiac Ischemia

[[cocaine induced chest pain can be treated with benzodiazepines]].

- [[acute pericarditis]]

# Management

## PCI timing

<!-- PCI timing -->

Prompt coronary reperfusion with PCI or fibrinolytic therapy restores blood flow, limits myocardial damage, and reduces  mortality. Current guidelines recommend primary PCI for patients with  acute STEMI as follows:

- Within **12 hours of symptom onset** AND
- Within **90 minutes** from first medical contact to device time at a PCI-capable facility OR
- Within 120 minutes from first medical contact to device time at a  non-PCI-capable facility (to allow time for transport to a PCI-capable  facility)

All such patients referred for emergency PCI should be pretreated with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.

## Complications

[[Atheroembolism is a complication of cardiac catherization]].

## Cardiac Event return to work

[[Patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction may return to work 2 weeks after initial event]].
