# Folic acid in pregnancy

<!--  folic acid in pregnancy doses -->

**All women planning pregnancy** should begin supplementing **0.4 mg of folic acid daily** **>1 month** prior to conception and continue through the first trimester of pregnancy to decrease the risk of **neural tube defects**.  Because many pregnancies are unplanned, it is recommended that women of childbearing age consume this amount daily. A higher dose of **4 mg daily** is recommended for women who have **risk factors for a neural tube defect** (eg, antiepileptic use, prior pregnancy with a neural tube defect).
