# multiple sclerosis

<!-- MS exacerbation and longterm rx, symptomatic sx -->

Treatment of acute **multiple sclerosis** (MS) **exacerbation** is indicated when disabling symptoms are present. Oral and intravenous (IV) **corticosteroids** are considered equally efficacious in hastening recovery. However,  this patient has optic neuritis and should initially receive IV  corticosteroids as oral corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk of recurrent optic neuritis **(Choice D)**.  An oral corticosteroid taper can be considered after IV therapy.  Plasmapheresis should be considered in glucocorticoid-refractory  patients **(Choice A)**.

Disease-modifying drugs (eg, **beta-interferon, glatiramer acetate**) are indicated for chronic maintenance therapy in patients with  relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) as they can decrease the  frequency of relapses and reduce the development of brain lesions.
