**First-line** treatment for **anorexia nervosa (AN)** involves **psychotherapy** and **nutritional rehabilitation** (establishing a structured and consistent meal pattern).  Pharmacotherapy is not an initial or primary treatment of AN and is generally used as an adjunct in treatment-resistant cases.

Although several types of psychotherapy have been used to treat AN, **cognitive-behavioral therapy** (CBT) is commonly recommended and is supported by multiple guidelines.  CBT focuses on the dysfunctional thoughts (eg, negative self-evaluation based on weight and shape) and behaviors (excessive food restriction) that maintain the disorder.  It is a structured and time-limited therapy that includes self-monitoring and homework between sessions.  Family therapy is also effective and is particularly recommended for adolescents.
