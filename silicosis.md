# silicosis

- related: [[Pulmonology]]

- pt: mining, hydraulic fracturing, sandblasting, and foundry work

- prevention: **Respiratory protection** (eg, particulate respirator) is the best strategy for preventing the disease

- pathology: macrophage reaction to silica by activating fibroblasts and cause collagen production

- sx:
	- 10-30 years later after exposure
	- asymptomatic
	- dyspnea on exertion, productive cough

- dx:
	- cxr: many **small, round opacities** that are distributed predominantly in the **upper lobes**
	- In advanced disease, the nodules can enlarge and coalesce, resulting in retraction of the hila, upper lobe fibrosis, and hyperinflation in the lower lobes
	- may sometimes show calcification of rim of hilar nodule (eggshell calcificaiton)
	- cavitation can also present

- complications
	- associated with TB due to impaired macrophage response
	- bronchogenic carcinoma
