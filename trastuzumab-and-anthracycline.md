<!-- medication cardiomyopathy, anthracycline vs trastuzumab -->

In most patients, trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity is **reversible**; there is complete recovery of cardiac function after treatment  discontinuation. In contrast, chronic anthracycline-associated  cardiotoxicity may not be reversible after treatment discontinuation due to myocyte necrosis, destruction, and replacement by fibrous tissue.
