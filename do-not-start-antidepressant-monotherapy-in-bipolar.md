# do not start antidepressant monotherapy in bipolar

- related: [[Psychiatry]]

This patient is now requesting sertraline as he believes it helped his depression in the past.  However, **antidepressant monotherapy** is **not indicated** for patients with **bipolar disorder** due to the increased **risk of inducing mania**.  The most appropriate next step is to educate the patient regarding the risks of antidepressants in his condition and explain why sertraline is not a good choice.  This can be followed by a discussion of other treatment options for bipolar depression such as alternative mood stabilizers to lithium (eg, lamotrigine, valproate) and second-generation antipsychotics (eg, quetiapine, lurasidone).
