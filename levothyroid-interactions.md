<!-- levothyroxine interactions that include absorption, TBG concentration, thyroid hormone metabolism -->

**Levothyroxine** has a **narrow therapeutic index**, and bioavailability is sensitive to a number of dietary factors. To  ensure adequate and consistent absorption, levothyroxine should be  administered on an empty stomach with water at least 30-60 minutes  before breakfast. In addition, a number of medications, including  over-the-counter drugs, **interfere** with the absorption of levothyroxine and must be administered at separate times to allow for proper uptake of the medication.

Common offenders include **calcium and iron** preparations. These supplements should be separated from levothyroxine by 3-4 hours. This patient is separating levothyroxine from calcium by only an hour, which is likely leading to decreased absorption of  levothyroxine and subsequent under-replacement. She should be counseled to take her calcium later in the day, and TSH should be rechecked in 6  weeks.
