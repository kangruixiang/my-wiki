# transcranial doppler US in sickle cell pts assesses stroke risks

- related: [[Sickle cell disease]]

**Sickle cell disease (SCD)** is the most common cause of **stroke in children**, such as in this patient with acute onset of right hemiplegia.  Ischemic strokes are more common than hemorrhagic strokes in patients with SCD.  Although the exact mechanism of **ischemic stroke** in patients with SCD is unclear, likely contributing factors include **vaso-occlusion** due to progressive stenosis from intimal proliferation as well as abnormal red blood cell-endothelial interactions.

Given the high risk of stroke in patients with SCD, **transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound** should be performed on all children age 2-16 with this condition.  TCD ultrasound measures the mean velocity of blood flow in the large cerebral arteries, with higher velocities observed in the stenotic arteries.  A high TCD velocity is associated with stroke, and these patients should undergo **chronic transfusion therapy** to decrease their risk.
