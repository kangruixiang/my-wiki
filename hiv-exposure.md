# HIV exposure

<!-- healthcare HIV exposure types, management -->

At risk exposures:
- **Percutaneous injury** from a contaminated needlestick or sharp object (eg, scalpel)
- **Mucous membrane** (eg, eyes) or **nonintact skin** exposure to infected body fluids
Types of risks:
- High risk:  **Blood**, fluids contaminated with visible blood, semen, and vaginal secretions
- Possible risk:  Cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, pericardial, and amniotic fluids
- Low risk: Body fluids such as **urine**, feces, tears, and vomitus are considered **noninfectious** if no visible blood is present.
Testing: 
- The exposed patient should be tested for HIV immediately, 4 to 6 weeks later, and 3 months after the exposure. 
PEP:
- Generally, 3 drug PEP (tenofovir, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir) is offered to patients with any risk of occupational transmission as guided by exposure type and body fluid involved.
- A two-drug regimen for postexposure prophylaxis (compared with pre-exposure prophylaxis) is no longer recommended.
- Protease inhibitors such as darunavir, whether boosted or not, are not recommended for prophylaxis because of their higher rates of adverse effects.
