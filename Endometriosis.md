**Endometriosis** is a progressive disease typically diagnosed in women age 25-35 and is thought to affect 5%-10% of all women. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus (eg, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cul-de-sac, uterosacral ligaments). Symptoms include **dysmenorrhea**, chronic pelvic pain, **deep dyspareunia**, dyschezia, and infertility. Clinical presentation varies and is dependent on the specific location of the endometrial implants in the pelvis. Pelvic examination findings include pain on lateral movement of the cervix; a fixed, immobile uterus; uterosacral nodularity; and adnexal masses, although examination is often normal.

Endometriosis can be treated medically or surgically. Tissue diagnosis with biopsy is not required to initiate treatment. **First-line treatment** for endometriosis is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and **combined oral contraceptives** as these are typically well tolerated. Combined oral contraceptives decrease the amount of endometrial implant shedding in the pelvis, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. Other pharmacotherapy includes progestin-only therapy (eg, medroxyprogesterone acetate), gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (eg, leuprolide), and danazol (a synthetic androgen). Surgical treatment involves excision of lesions, and definitive treatment is with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
