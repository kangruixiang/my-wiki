<!-- cns lymphoma improved prognosis marker -->

Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a common malignancy  in patients with advanced HIV infections, and is strongly related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is usually associated with a significant  degree of immunosuppression. Most patients with PCNSL have a  persistently depressed CD4 count (< 50/μL).

Institution of HAART therapy is associated with an improved prognosis, especially  in patients who demonstrate an improvement in the immune status (e.g.  increase in CD4 count and decrease in viral load), because the degree of immunosuppression seems to be the major determinant of these patients'  survival.
