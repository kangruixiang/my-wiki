**Peripartum cardiomyopathy** (PPCM) is heart failure that occurs between 36 weeks gestation and 5 months  postpartum. Risk factors include maternal age >30, multiple  gestation, and preeclampsia. Patients present with left heart failure  symptoms (eg, dyspnea), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  <45%, and no other cause of heart failure (ie, diagnosis of  exclusion). Management of PPCM is similar to that of other causes of  systolic heart failure. Patients who develop PPCM during pregnancy are  delivered based on maternal stability.

After delivery:

- Some patients will have **spontaneous resolution** of ventricular dysfunction and can discontinue their medication regimen; however, there is a **risk of recurrence**, with patients with LVEF <20% at diagnosis at highest risk.
- Patients with **persistent PPCM** are at risk for further LV function decline and death in subsequent pregnancies.

Therefore, **regardless of PPCM resolution**, patients are evaluated with serial **echocardiograms** for a few years **(Choice D)**. Those with recurrent or persistent LV dysfunction are advised to avoid pregnancy.
