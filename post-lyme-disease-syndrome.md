<!-- post lyme disease syndrome sx -->

Post–Lyme disease syndrome has been reported in approximately 10% of patients after treatment. Although often erroneously called “chronic Lyme disease,” studies have found no microbiologic evidence of chronic or latent infection after appropriate treatment.

Symptoms include **fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, and impairment of memory or cognition** that can **last for years** after treatment of the acute infection.

PLDS is thought to be due to a disordered immunologic response to the preceding infection. Most patients slowly improve over a period of 6 months, and treatment is directed toward symptom amelioration.

Clinical trials have shown no benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment for post–Lyme disease syndrome. Evaluation for coinfection with another tick-borne pathogen or for a noninfectious cause is indicated; when no alternative diagnosis is found, treatment is symptomatic.
