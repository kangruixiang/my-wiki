# acute pericarditis

<!--  acute pericarditis rx -->

High-dose aspirin (eg, 650 mg 3 times a day) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic relief.  High-dose aspirin is believed to provide analgesia and anti-inflammatory effect while having a relatively small effect on myocardial healing and scar formation compared to other anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, glucocorticoids).

Naproxen in combination with colchicine is the treatment of choice for most patients with idiopathic or viral acute pericarditis.  However, it is recommended that NSAIDs other than aspirin be avoided for treatment of Peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP) as they may impair myocardial healing and increase the risk of ventricular septal or free wall rupture.  For the same reason, glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) should be avoided as well.
