# herpes in pregnancy

- related: [[Infections in Pregnancy]]

- The most common mode of vertical transmission is **direct contact** between the fetus and genital tract lesions (eg, cervix, vagina, vulva) during **vaginal delivery**.

- low risk of vertical transmission in patients without an active HSV lesion or prodromal symptoms (eg, malaise, myalgia).

- the most effective strategy to **decrease the risk of vertical transmission** is to prevent an active HSV lesion at the time of delivery with suppression

- Therefore, patients with a history of HSV are provided **acyclovir suppression beginning at 36 weeks gestation** that is continued until delivery.

- At delivery, patients without prodromal symptoms or active genital HSV lesions can be delivered vaginally as the risk for perinatal transmission is minimal.

- Patients with active genital HSV at delivery require a cesarean delivery to prevent direct contact between the fetus and the lesion
