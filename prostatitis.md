<!-- bacterial prostatitis sx, dx, rx. Acute vs chronic vs UTI -->

- Sx: fever, dysuria, frequency, pyuria, bacteriuria
- Ddx: **UTI with cystitis** vs **acute bacterial prostatitis**
	- UTI: usually with structural problem, **BPH** or recent instrument
	- acute bacterial prostatitis: young, middle aged men, normal anatomy with **perineal discomfort** or bladder obstruction
- Dx:
	- Must perform **digital rectal exam**. Presence of **prostate** tenderness, edema, warmth indicates prostatitis.
	- UA shows bacteruria usually gm-, e.Coli, proteus.
- Rx:
	- UTI: short course cipro, bactrim
	- acute prostatitis: similar abx, 6 weeks

**chronic prostatitis**

- ddx: either chronic pelvic pain syndrome or chronic bacterial. CPPS more common.
- dx: UA shows **>20 leukocytes/hpf**.
- Urine culture results then differentiate patients as having either:
	- **Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome** (CP/CPPS) - urine culture results are **aseptic**
	- Chronic bacterial prostatitis – urine culture results show bacteriuria (>10 fold increase after prostate massage)
- rx: The underlying cause of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) remains unclear.  As a result, there is much uncertainty about the ideal approach to treatment.  Most patients receive a combination of therapies including medications for prostate enlargement (eg, alpha blockers), antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and/or psychotherapy.
