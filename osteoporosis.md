		- Low bone mass with a history of **fragility fracture**
		- Bone density criteria for **osteoporosis** (T-score <−2.5 on DXA)
		- Osteopenia (T-score between −1 and −2.5) with a **10-year probability** for major osteoporotic fracture **>20%** or hip fracture >3% based on the FRAX risk calculator
