# Lung nodules

<!-- solidary pulmonary nodule features, management, malignant vs benign characters -->

- features:
	- Rounded opacity
	- ≤3 cm in diameter (>3 cm is considered a "mass")
	- Surrounded by pulmonary parenchyma
	- No associated lymph node enlargement
- management
	- compare prior xray or CT
	- if stable appearance/size 2-3 years, no further workup
	- if change in appearance, obtain CT
	- if no prior CT/xray, obtain CT to identify other lesions
	- if >0.8 cm, further management (biopsy) and surveillance
	- PET can be used if tissue diagnosis unclear
- benign characters:
	- round appearance
	- ground glass
	- < 0.6 cm
- malignant characters:
	- partially solid (heterogenous)
	- spiculated appearance
	- \>0.8 cm upper lobe location

<!-- features of lung nodules that are malignant vs benign -->

Certain patterns of calcification within the pulmonary nodule are strongly suggestive of benign lesions, including **popcorn**, concentric or **laminated, central**, and **diffuse homogeneous** calcifications. Popcorn calcification is characteristically seen on  radiographic imaging in patients with pulmonary hamartoma. Eccentric  calcification (area of asymmetric calcification), as well as reticular  or punctate calcification, should raise suspicion for malignancy.
