<!-- congenital syphilis sx -->

_Treponema pallidum_ crosses the placenta; a **syphilis infection during pregnancy** can result in **vertical transmission**, leading to **adverse fetal outcomes** including fetal growth restriction, intrauterine fetal demise, and congenital syphilis (eg, hepatomegaly, jaundice, rash, skeletal abnormalities).
