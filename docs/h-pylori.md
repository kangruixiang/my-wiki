_Helicobacter pylori_ **eradication should be confirmed** for patients with the following:

- **persistent symptoms**
- _H pylori_-associated ulcer on endoscopy
- evidence of an _H pylori_-associated malignancy (eg, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma).

Common methods for determining bacterial eradication include **urea breath testing** and **fecal antigen testing**.  Testing should occur >4 weeks after the completion of therapy.  If testing confirms eradication but symptoms remain, other etiologies should also be considered.  In patients who do not clear the infection after first-line therapy, second-line options such as quadruple therapy or sequential therapy involving distinct antibiotics should be used.
