# Hepatorenal syndrome

- related: [[GI]]

## Pathophysiology

<!-- hepatorenal syndrome causes and pathogenesis -->

- important complication of end stage liver disease
- liver: portal HTN => increase NO, vasodilators => **splanchnic arterial dilation** (celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric arteries) => hypotension
- kidney: decrease in renal perfusion => activates RAAS => **renal vasoconstriction** with **decreased** perfusion and **glomerular filtration**.

<!-- hepatorenal syndrome triggers -->

Triggers:

- Decreased perfusion/volume:
	- GI bleed, sepsis, vomiting, diuretic use, NSAID use
	- ascites
	- too much lactulose
- SBP

## Diagnosis

<!--  hepatorenal syndrome diagnosis -->

- decreased renal perfusion (decrease in GFR) without another clear cause
	- Cr > 1.5
	- BUN:Cr elevated > 20:1
- no tubular injury: no RBC, protein, granular casts in urine
	- protein excretion < 500 mg/d
- no obstruction: US benign
- Hyponatremia (dilutional hyponatremia)
	- low Na excretion in urine (<10 mmol/L)
- lack of improvement with volume resuscitation (BUN:Cr could be high in either prerenal or hepatorenal)
- look for triggers: **paracentesis** if has ascites

## Treatment

<!-- hepatorenal syndrome treatment -->

- Goal: increase MAP > 82
- Address triggers (hypovolemia, anemia, infection)
- Limit diuretics
- Plasma expander **albumin**
	- IV bolus (1g/kg per day, up to 100g max)
	- followed by 25-50g/day until midodrine/octreotide discontinued
	- continue 2-3 days
- Splanchnic vasoconstrictors
	- midodrine (alpha agonist): 7.5 mg, titrate q8h up to 15 mg TID
	- octreotide (inhibits vasodilation): gtt 50 mcg/hr or SQ
	- norepinephrine
- TIPS
- Liver transplant
- Dialysis may be attempted to help bridge to liver transplantation.
