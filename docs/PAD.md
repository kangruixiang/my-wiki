In addition to cardiovascular risk factor management (eg, smoking cessation), a **supervised exercise program** is the best initial management for **claudication** due to **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**. Patients should participate in 30-45 minutes of supervised walking >3 times a week for >3 months. Once the walking time required to  develop claudication is determined, the sessions are gradually increased until the patient can walk for a longer period without developing  symptoms. Patients may experience **moderate increases in symptom-free walking distance**.

For patients with persistent symptoms despite smoking cessation,  antiplatelet and statin therapy, and supervised exercise therapy, the  addition of twice-daily cilostazol may lead to improvement in symptoms.

Revascularization via percutaneous stent placement or surgical bypass  grafting is generally reserved for patients with critical limb ischemia  or for those who continue to have claudication symptoms despite  cardiovascular risk factor management, exercise, and pharmacologic  therapy.

## Limb Ischemia

This patient has **acute limb ischemia (ALI)** with an immediately **threatened extremity**.  ALI is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion and is most often caused by acute arterial occlusion due to systemic embolism from a  cardiac source (eg, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, or  septic emboli from infective endocarditis). Patients typically have the **six P's** of acute ischemia: **pain, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, poikilothermia**, and **paralysis**.

Patients with ALI with threatened viability of the limb have severe pain (rest  pain) with sensory and/or motor loss, delayed capillary refill, and  inaudible arterial Doppler signals. All patients with clinical signs  and symptoms of ALI should receive **anticoagulation** (ie, intravenous heparin bolus followed by continuous heparin infusion)  immediately while awaiting further interventions. Anticoagulation  prevents thrombus propagation and formation of new distal thrombus due  to stasis. Patients with an immediately-threatened extremity are at  increased risk for **irreversible myonecrosis within 4â€“6 hours** and should have **emergency surgical revascularization**.

Noninvasive vascular imaging with duplex ultrasonography, CT  angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography is a reasonable option  for patients with viable ALI that is not under immediate threat of  tissue necrosis. Such patients typically have intact arterial and  venous Doppler signals and no sensory or motor deficits.

Patients with an ischemic but viable extremity on examination can be  managed with catheter-based thrombolytic therapy or surgical  revascularization. Catheter-based intra-arterial administration has  better clinical outcomes and fewer bleeding complications than  intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents.
