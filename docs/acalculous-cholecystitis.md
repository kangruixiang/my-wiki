# acalculous cholecystitis

- related: [[GI]]

This patient in the intensive care unit has fever with CT scan evidence of **acalculous cholecystitis**.

Acalculous cholecystitis is due to gallbladder stasis with resultant ischemia of the gallbladder wall.  Most cases occur in the hospitalized setting, particularly in patients who are **critically ill**.  Suspicion is often raised when a hospitalized patient develops unexplained fever, leukocytosis, and jaundice.  Unlike calculous cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis is usually accompanied by elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminases.

The diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis is typically confirmed when abdominal ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen reveals **gallbladder wall thickening** with **no choleliths** or biliary tree dilation.  Treatment with intravenous antibiotics (after blood cultures) and placement of a **percutaneous cholecystostomy tube** usually results in improvement within 24 hours.
