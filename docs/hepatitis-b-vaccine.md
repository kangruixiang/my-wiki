## Vaccine types

<!-- hepatitis B vaccine types, which one to use -->

The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the use of the following vaccine formulations:

- Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines (conventional)
	- **Recombivax HB** (10 mcg HBsAg/mL)
	- **Engerix-B** (20 mcg HBsAg/mL)
- Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (CpG-adjuvanted)
	- **Heplisav-B** (20 mcg HBsAg/0.5 mL)

Recombivax HB and Engerix-B use an aluminum adjuvant and typically require three doses over a six-month period to provide protection. These vaccines used to contain very small amounts of thimerosal, but those formulations were discontinued.

In November 2017, a new recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (designated HepB-CpG; sold as Heplisav-B) received approval for use in adults 18 years of age and older. This vaccine consists of recombinant HBsAg with a novel immunostimulatory adjuvan. The vaccine is administered as two intramuscular doses given one month apart. It is not clear when this vaccine will be available outside of the United States.

- For most patients, use Engerix-B and Recombivax HB
- Use Heplisav-B for patients unlikely to follow up with 3 dose vaccine and those needing rapid protection
- Pregnant women: use the conventional vaccines (no teratogenic effect)
