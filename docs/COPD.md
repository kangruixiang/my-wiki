# COPD

<!-- antibiotics criteria for COPD -->

Antibiotics are generally not recommended for management of acute  bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals as most exacerbations are of viral etiology. However, guidelines from the Global Initiative for  Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommend antibiotic therapy for patients who have a COPD exacerbation with any two of the following  features: increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume, or  increased dyspnea. Antibiotics are also recommended for those requiring mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive).
