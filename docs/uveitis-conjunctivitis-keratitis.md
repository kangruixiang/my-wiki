<!-- uveitis sx, dx, rx -->

Anterior uveitis (iritis) is characterized by pain, redness, **variable visual loss**, and a **constricted and irregular** pupil.

Most cases are due to an underlying infection (eg, AIDS) or systemic inflammatory disease.  Manifestations typically include:

- Erythema at the limbus (junction of cornea and sclera)
- A constricted pupil
- Blurred vision
- Moderate eye pain

To properly distinguish iritis from other causes  of a red eye, it is important to visualize the anterior segment of the eye with slit lamp examination. If leukocytes are seen in the anterior  segment, which contains the aqueous humor found between the cornea and  the lens, then the diagnosis of iritis is confirmed. A hazy "flare," which is indicative of protein accumulation secondary to a damaged blood-aqueous barrier, may also be seen.

Patients with suspected anterior uveitis should be referred to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis.  Investigation of the underlying cause is then required. [[Patient with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, anterior uveitis likely has sarcoidosis]].

Treatment for iritis depends on the etiology of the condition, and typically includes antimicrobial therapy for viral or bacterial causes and topical corticosteroids for noninfectious causes.

## Conjunctivitis

 <!-- ignore -->

Conjunctivitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and is made in a patient with **red eye and  discharge** only if **vision is normal** and there is no evidence of glaucoma, iritis, or keratitis.

## Conjunctivitis

**Bacterial conjunctivitis** is highly contagious and presents with **conjunctival erythema** and **mucopurulent discharge**.  The discharge is often thick and accumulates quickly, causing matting  of the eyelid. The condition is often unilateral although it can be  bilateral. Bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, but  topical antibiotics are prescribed to shorten symptom duration and  reduce person-to-person transmission.

The most common causes of bacterial conjunctivitis are _Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis,_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_. First-line treatment is typically erythromycin ointment or polymyxin-trimethoprim drops. However, the incidence of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ conjunctivitis is much higher among **contact lens wearers**, such as this child. Therefore, topical **fluoroquinolones** (eg, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) are preferred for contact lens wearers; erythromycin, macrolides **(Choice E)**, and polymyxin-trimethoprim have limited activity against _P aeruginosa_.

Bacterial conjunctivitis can progress to bacterial **keratitis**, which most commonly occurs in patients who wear contact lenses improperly (eg, overnight use) or have decreased immunity (eg,  corticosteroid use).

## Keratitis

<!-- keratitis sx, dx, rx, complications -->

Keratitis is an **inflammation** of the **cornea**, the clear tissue covering the pupil and iris and bordered by the bulbar conjunctivae. Infectious keratitis can be due to a variety of  organisms, including bacteria (eg, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_), viruses (eg, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus), fungi, or parasites (eg, _Acanthamoeba_).

This patient with conjunctivitis has now developed signs of **keratitis**, which presents with **severe photophobia**, blurred or **impaired vision**, and a **foreign body sensation** with **difficulty opening the affected eye**. Penlight examination reveals a corneal opacity or  infiltrate. When keratitis is suspected, the patient should be seen **urgently** by an **ophthalmologist** to confirm the diagnosis and begin treatment.

The diagnosis of keratitis is made by slit-lamp examination showing corneal ulceration. The epithelial injury is readily visible with  fluorescein. Cultures of corneal scraping should be obtained to help  guide definitive antibiotic therapy. While those cultures are  processing, empiric therapy should be changed to topical, combination  antibiotic therapy that has broad-spectrum activity against  gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including _Pseudomonas_. Keratitis can cause **scarring** or ulceration of the cornea and subsequent **blindness** if not aggressively treated.

## Endophthalmitis

<!-- endophthalmitis causes -->

Endophthalmitis is a bacterial infection of the deep eye (vitreous) due  to either direct inoculation into the globe (eg, surgery, trauma) or  hematogenous spread. It is not a complication of bacterial  conjunctivitis.

## Hordeolum

Hordeolum (stye) is a bacterial infection of the sebaceous glands in the eyelid. Patients have tenderness, redness, and swelling at the eyelid  margins. Hordeolum is not a complication of bacterial conjunctivitis.
