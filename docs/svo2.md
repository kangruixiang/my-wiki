- must be obtained from pulmonary artery catheter
- ScvO2 (central venous O2) useful surrogate and measured via CVC in SVC, measures venous blood from upper half of body
- normal 65-70%
- If low:
	- increased demand: hyperthemia, shiver, pain, seizure
	- decreased delivery: anemia, bleeding, dilution
- if high (>0.8): high flow states, sepsis, hyperthyroidism, severe liver disease
