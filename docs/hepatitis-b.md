Source patients positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg have transmission rates of 40%-60%; those with only HBsAg positivity have reduced transmission rates of 20%-40%. As a result, all health care workers (HCWs) are required to be offered hepatitis B vaccination by their employer. Immune response (ie, hepatitis surface antibody >10 mIU/mL) should be documented 1-2 months after the last vaccine dose. HCWs who do not respond to the first series of injections should be revaccinated.

HCWs with an adequate response to the vaccine (initial hepatitis surface antibody \[HBsAb] titer of >10 mIU/mL) are not at risk of contracting the virus and do not require post-exposure prophylaxis even if subsequent antibody titers fall below the threshold for immunity. **Post-exposure prophylaxis** for exposed **nonimmune** HCWs (unvaccinated or incomplete response to initial vaccination series) involves immediate **simultaneous administration** of both **hepatitis B immunoglobulin** (HBIG) and **HBV vaccine** (at different sites). The HCW should then receive the remaining 2 series of HBV vaccine according to the routine schedule.

Infants born to mothers with active hepatitis B infection are at risk for acquiring hepatitis B either in utero or, more commonly, during **delivery** due to exposure to infected genital secretions. Maternal **viral load** is the primary risk factor and directly correlates with the risk of vertical transmission to the infant. However, with prompt administration of **hepatitis B vaccine** and **immunoglobulin** to the infant, the risk for infection decreases to <5%.

Infants who are vertically infected with hepatitis B generally develop **chronic** infection in an **immune-tolerant** phase. These infants characteristically have very high viral loads and positive HBeAg, but remain asymptomatic and have normal or minimally elevated liver enzymes. Therefore, liver function tests cannot be used to detect infection **(Choice E)**. Instead, exposed infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin within 12 hours of birth, followed by completion of the **normal hepatitis B series** (at age 0, 2, and 6 months). Serology should be obtained at the subsequent well-child visit, usually at age 9 months. If HBsAg is not detected at that time, the infant is uninfected.


## Hepatitis B

<!-- acute HBV rx, liver failure criteria -->

**Acute hepatitis B** virus (HBV)  infection is characterized by elevated aminotransferases, positive  hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B IgM core antibody, hepatitis B e antigen (indicator of high infectivity), and detectable hepatitis B  DNA. Nearly 70% of patients with acute HBV infection are asymptomatic.  The remaining 30% develop symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, jaundice,  and right upper quadrant discomfort; however, even symptomatic patients  are at **very low risk** of acute **liver failure** or other significant complications. Therefore, unlike many forms of  acute liver injury, most cases of acute HBV (even with marked elevations in aminotransferases) **resolve spontaneously** and can be managed with **outpatient supportive care and close follow-up**.

Hospitalization is typically reserved for patients with severe illness, increased risk  of short-term complications, or significant comorbid conditions. This  generally includes patients with significant fever or hemodynamic  instability, impaired hepatic synthetic function (eg, abnormal  coagulation markers), or other signs of acute liver failure (eg,  encephalopathy). Hospitalization can also be considered for patients  age >50, have poor oral intake, or have minimal social support.

Antiviral therapy is recommended for patients with  immunosuppression, concurrent hepatitis C, severe hepatitis, or  fulminant hepatic failure.

Although most patients with evidence of acute liver injury require  admission for evaluation and management, those with clear evidence of  acute HBV are extremely unlikely to develop liver failure or associated  complications and do not require hospitalization if close outpatient  monitoring can be arranged.

The 3 criteria for acute liver failure are evidence of hepatic injury  (eg, elevated aminotransferases), encephalopathy, and INR â‰¥1.5; this  patient has only 1 of these 3 criteria. Given the very low risk of  progression to acute (fulminant) liver failure due to acute HBV  infection (<1%), admission to the intensive care unit is not  warranted.

Liver  biopsy is indicated for patients with unclear etiology of hepatic injury after initial evaluation or for staging of chronic liver disease prior  to treatment. It is not needed in this patient with acute hepatitis who has a clear cause of disease.

As patients recover from **acute hepatitis B** virus (HBV) infection, there is normally a **steady drop** in both **aminotransferase** and **HBV DNA levels**.  Aminotransferase levels typically normalize within 2-8 weeks. Patients who do not clear hepatitis B surface antigen after 6 months are  diagnosed with progression to chronic HBV infection. In addition, some  patients may develop complications such as acute liver failure or  coagulopathy during the initial phase of infection. Consequently,  patients should be **monitored regularly** to evaluate for the development of chronic HBV infection or hepatic decompensation.

Symptom resolution is variable and partially depends on severity of initial  presentation. Patients with a milder onset may recover completely  within days, whereas those with a more severe presentation (eg,  bilirubin >10 mg/dL) may report fatigue and nausea for months  following acute infection.

Antiviral therapy has not been demonstrated to significantly change the course of acute HBV infection, but it may be considered for patients  who have acute liver failure, immunosuppression, concomitant hepatitis C or D, or preexisting liver disease.
