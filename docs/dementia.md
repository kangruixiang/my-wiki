# Normal Aging vs MCI vs Dementia

| Normal aging                        | mild cognitive impairment | Dementia   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| cognitive test -                    | test +                    | test +     |
| function normal (act independently) | function normal           | function - |

# Workup

- look for reversible causes first
- if no reversible causes, organic dementia

# Reversible Causes

- TSH/T4
- CMP: BUN/Cr
- LFT: liver cirrhosis
- B12
- RPR
- Screen for depression/pseudodementia
- CT/MRI: look for hydrocephalus, hematoma
