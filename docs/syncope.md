# syncope

- related: [[Cardiology]], [[pacemaker]]
---

- syncope: short ddx
- presyncope: very long ddx
- good history is very important
	- differentiate between true syncope vs presyncope
	- does this sound like arrhythmia, tachy brady syndrome
	- cereral hypoperfusion
		- abrupt, no prodromal, no confusion
		- lights off/on
		- no tired/confused/postictal
	- PE: carotid sound
	- ECG

## Bradycardia

- HR < 60
- problems with
	- SA node
	- AV node or purkinje
	- extrinsic: vagal tones
- sinus node dysfunction
	- usually **asymptomatic**, syncope, fatigue, lightheadedness
	- ECG:
		- sinus arrest, junctional escape rhythm
		- sinus bradycardia
		- sinus with pauses
		- tachy brady syndrome: SVT/af/aflutter, sinus node shut down from fibrosis/rate control blockade/suppression. At time of conversion, goes into long pauses
- sinoatrial exit block: failure of impulse to exit SA
- secondary sinoatrial exit block:
	- failure of p wave to form
		- ![20210516094821](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210516094821.png)
	- p to p shortening, followed by drop beat
- Treatment
	- symptomatic patient: pacemaker
	- atrial based pacing support
	- most patient get RV lead for backup
	- high vagal tone: very dramatic bradycardia with normal HR between episodes
		- sinus slowing before bradycardia
		- ![20210516094834](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210516094834.png)
		- nausea, vomiting, diaphoretic
	- SA node dysfunction: lower HR at baseline

## AV nodal block

- primary: no AV block, just delayed, prolonged PR
	- no treatment

- tertiary: AV dissociation in HIS purkinje
	- sx determined by rate of escape
	- pause dependent VT: torsades de pointe => syncope

- AV node itself
	- Lupus
	- Lyme disease
	- iatrogenic: putting in pacemaker, AV node ablation

- treatment
	- treat if EF < 40%
	- biV pacemaker
	- RV pacing alone = worse EF
	- Pace RV: wide QRS, LBBB
	- if RBBB develops followed by pacing: biV pacemaker
	- < 30%: ICD CRT biV pacing
	- CXR: pacemaker = skinny. atrial = ventricular
	- icd: coil at RV insertion
	- Biv: 3rd lead, RV anterior, LV posterior

- 2nd AVB

- Mobitz 1: progressively longer P, PR longer, drops, regularly irregular

- canon A waves, progressively softer 1st heart sound
	- ![20210516094905](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210516094905.png)

- Mobitz 2: HIS. Ppx pacing

- fixed PR

- dropped beat

- wide QRS

- before/after drop beat, changes in PR the greatest

- 2:1 weckeback: Mobitz 1 has narrow QRS. Mobitz 2 has wide QRS

- walk the patient: increase sympathetic tone. Type 1 gets better on atropine.

This patient has most likely experienced cardiogenic syncope due to ventricular tachycardia (VT); scarring from previous myocardial infarction (evidenced by Q waves on ECG) increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.  Syncope due to VT usually has no warning symptoms (other than palpitations in some patients).  The arrhythmia spontaneously terminates within a few minutes, resulting in restoration of cardiac output and rapid patient recovery with no residual symptoms.
