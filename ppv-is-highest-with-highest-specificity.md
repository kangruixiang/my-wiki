The sensitivity of a test, given by TP / (TP + FN), is the  probability that a patient with a given disease will have a positive  result on that test; for a highly **sensitive** test, a **n**egative  result helps rule **out** a disease (**SnNout**). Higher sensitivity  means fewer FNs. Similarly, the specificity of a test, given by TN /  (TN + FP), is the probability that a patient without a given disease  will have a negative test result on that test; for a highly **specific** test, a **p**ositive result helps rule **in** a disease (**SpPin**).  Higher specificity means fewer FPs.

**Positive predictive value** (PPV), given by TP / (TP + **_FP_**), is the probability that a  positive test correctly identifies an individual with the disease.  Because higher specificity is associated with **fewer FPs**, higher  specificity will, in the vast majority of cases, increase the PPV of the test (because FP is the denominator of PPV). In this case, the test  with **highest specificity** (97%) is the best choice as it will most  likely also has the **highest PPV**.
