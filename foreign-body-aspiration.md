<!-- pediatric foreign body aspiration management, which ones to treat -->

- Obtain **2-view** (posteroanterior \[PA] and lateral) neck and chest x-ray top confirm the location of the foreign body
	- an esophageal coin appears linear on lateral x-ray; a tracheal coin appears linear (project on end) in the PA view.
- Xray also distinguishes between a coin and battery (the latter can cause perforation in just a few hours).
	- A coin is seen in this patient's x-ray as a **homogenous** object with a **sharp, crisp edge**; the bilaminar structure of a button battery causes a "double-ring" sign.
- Coins are the most common gastrointestinal foreign bodies.  They are considered low risk due to the lack of sharp edges and nontoxic material. High-risk objects (eg, button batteries, magnets, sharp items) typically require endoscopic removal regardless of symptoms due to the risk of necrosis and perforation of the gastrointestinal tract.
- Asymptomatic patients with coin ingestion <24 hours earlier can be observed with repeat x-rays in 12-24 hours to ensure passage beyond the pylorus. Children who had an **unknown time of ingestion**, such as this patient, or those who are **symptomatic** should undergo **flexible endoscopy** for coin removal. Coins lodged >24 hours are at significant risk for complications (eg, erosion, perforation).
- Emergency bronchoscopy would be appropriate for an airway foreign body causing respiratory compromise.
