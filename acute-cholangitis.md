Acute cholangitis is an **ascending bacterial infection of the common bile duct.** It is a complication of choledocholithiasis. The biliary tract is typically sterile; however, **biliary obstruction** (eg, gallstone, bile duct stenosis,  cholangiocarcinoma) or incompetence of the sphincter of Oddi (eg, due to previous sphincterotomy) can disrupt normal bile flow mechanisms and allow bacteria from the duodenum to ascend the biliary tract, causing  infection. Less commonly, hematogenous spread of bacteria to the  biliary tract may occur.

The most common contributing organisms are:

- **_E. coli_ (25 to 50%)**
- **_Klebsiella pneumonia_ (15 to 20%)**
- **_Enterobacter_ species (5 to 10%)**
- **_Enterococcus_ species (10 to 20%)**
- **_Bacteroides_ and Clostridia (anaerobes, usually part of a mixed infection)**

Patients classically have the **Charcot  triad** of pain in the right upper quadrant, fever, and jaundice (up to  75% of cases), and some patients can be severely ill with the additional findings of hypotension and altered mental status (Reynolds pentad).

Reynolds' pentad **indicates suppurative cholangitis**, a complication of acute cholangitis. It consists of the **same three criteria of Charcot‚Äôs triad**, plus the **addition of altered mental status and hypotension** due to septic shock.

Laboratory findings typically show leukocytosis as well as a  **cholestatic pattern** of liver function tests with marked elevation in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and milder elevation in  aminotransferases.

Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant  demonstrating biliary duct dilation can be helpful in the initial diagnosis. Imaging would show bile duct dilation without gas in biliary tree as opposed to emphysematous cholecystitis.

Aggressive intravenous volume resuscitation should be  administered, and blood cultures should be collected, followed  immediately by empiric antibiotic therapy offering broad coverage of  enteric organisms (eg, **piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin with metronidazole**). Definitive treatment requires biliary drainage (eg, gallstone removal, stent placement), which is best accomplished by  **endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)** within 24-48  hours or more urgently in severe cases.

If the patient is unable to be managed via IV fluids and antibiotics, the following procedures may be considered:

- **Decompression and drainage of biliary system**
- **Endoscopic drainage**
- **Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)**
- **Surgical decompression if endoscopic procedure is unsuccessful**
