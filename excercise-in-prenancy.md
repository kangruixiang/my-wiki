<!-- exercise in pregnancy contraindications -->

- Recommended exercises:
	- **30 minutes** of **moderately intense** **aerobic exercise** (the patient should be able to converse while exercising) on **most or all days** of the week
	- Patients who are already conditioned for long-duration, high-intensity exercise can safely continue their regimen during pregnancy.
	- light weight (10lb) resistance training is safe
- Not recommended exercises
	- pregnancy shifts center of gravity, more risk of falling
	- avoid high risk of fall (gymnastic, skiing, horseback riding)
	- avoid contact sports
	- can swim but not **scuba dive** due to risk of air embolus formation and risk of fetal decompression sickness
	- training that involves marked straining, heavy resistance, or Valsalva maneuver is not recommended as it may decrease uteroplacental blood flow temporarily.

Exercise **contraindicated** in certain at-risk patient populations. Exercise should be avoided by:

- Patients at risk for preterm delivery
	- [[Cervical insufficiency]]
	- Preterm labor during current pregnancy
	- Preterm premature rupture of membranes
- Patients at risk for antepartum bleeding
	- Placenta previa
	- Persistent second- or third-trimester bleeding
- Patients with an underlying condition that could be exacerbated by exercise
	- Severe anemia
	- Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (eg, preeclampsia)
	- Restrictive lung disease
	- Severe heart disease

Cervical insufficiency, a structural cervical weakness associated with painless second-trimester pregnancy loss, is managed with placement of a cerclage. A cerclage is a permanent suture placed around the cervix to reinforce it and help prevent preterm delivery. Patients with a cerclage and history of cervical insufficiency should avoid exercise during pregnancy to minimize the risk of preterm delivery.
