# heparin induced thrombocytopenia

- related: [[Hemeonc]]

This patient with likely _Escherichia coli_ pyelonephritis has mild thrombocytopenia, prolonged INR/PTT, and low to normal fibrinogen, raising suspicion for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).  On hospital day 2, her platelet count drops to 105,000/mm3; the likely etiologies include ongoing DIC, antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone), or **heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type 1**.

HIT type 1 is a mild thrombocytopenia caused by nonimmune-mediated platelet aggregation.  Nadirs of approximately 100,000/mm3 occur <2 days after heparin initiation, and platelet counts return to normal **without any alteration in management**.

Conversely, HIT type 2 is life-threatening, requires aggressive treatment, and is characterized by the 4 Ts:

- Thrombocytopenia - platelets typically **decline >30%-50%**
- Timing - onset **5-10 days after heparin** initiation or <1 day with prior, recent heparin exposure
- Thrombosis - new thrombosis, progressive thrombosis, or skin necrosis
- Alternative causes - no other sources for thrombocytopenia are present or likely

This patient has minimal evidence of HIT type 2; she would not require evaluation with platelet factor 4 (HIT) antibody or treatment with enoxaparin discontinuation and argatroban **(Choices D and E)**.
