<!-- intestinal helminths types, sx, dx, treatment -->

This patient who recently visited Guatemala has  gastrointestinal symptoms, positive occult fecal blood, and significant  peripheral eosinophilia, suggesting **intestinal helminths**.

Intestinal helminths are largely a disease of the developing world where water and sewage sanitation is poor. In these regions, more than a billion  people are infected with the most common helminths including _Ascaris lumbricoides_ (roundworm), _Trichuris trichiura_ (whipworm), and _Ancylostoma duodenale_ (hookworm). In the United States, most cases arise in travelers returning from a developing region or in recent immigrants.

Clinical manifestations typically reflect the life cycle of the infecting helminth with early, transient **pulmonary** symptoms (eg, dry cough, dyspnea) followed by long-term **gastrointestinal** symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea). **Peripheral eosinophilia** is a defining feature, and patients often have positive fecal occult  blood. Diagnosis is usually made with stool ova and parasite testing.  Treatment with oral **albendazole** is typically curative (mebendazole is slightly better for whipworm).
