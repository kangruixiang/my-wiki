This infant has an indirect **inguinal hernia**, caused by bowel protrusion through a patent processus vaginalis.  At rest, most patients are asymptomatic with no palpable mass. As  intraabdominal pressure increases (eg, crying, straining), the  intestines protrude through the defect and cause a **painless groin mass**. The hernia is typically **reducible**, allowing the bowel to return to its original location.

However, hernias can become irreducible (ie, incarcerated) at any time, possibly while the patient awaits repair. Delaying treatment >2 weeks after  diagnosis doubles the risk of incarceration. If **incarceration** occurs, it can lead to irreversible **bowel ischemia** due to compromised blood supply to the entrapped intestines. Therefore, management of a reducible inguinal hernia is **prompt surgical correction** within **1-2 weeks** of presentation.

Reassurance and observation are appropriate for hydroceles, as they typically self-resolve by age 1. A hydrocele presents as an  asymptomatic cystic fluid collection in the scrotum, not as a reducible  mass. Inguinal hernias do not spontaneously resolve.
