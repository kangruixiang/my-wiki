# Urethral hypermobility

## Q Tip

<!-- Q tip test use -->

The Q-tip test is performed to diagnose urethral hypermobility, a common cause of stress urinary incontinence. A cotton swab is placed inside the urethra to measure the extent of urethra mobility during the Valsalva maneuver; a positive test has a >30-degree angle of movement.
