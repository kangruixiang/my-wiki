# calcium renal stones

- related: [[Nephrology]]

- pts with **continued nephrolithiasis** over 3-6 months should have drug intervention
	- thiazide, allopurinol, potassium citrate
	- This patient has had 2 episodes of nephrolithiasis separated by 4 years; he should undergo dietary interventions prior to considering drug treatment.

**Dietary interventions** can often correct the underlying abnormality and prevent recurrence.

This patient has a history of a calcium stone, the most common type of kidney stone.  Patients with calcium stones are generally advised to do the following:

- **Increase fluid intake** – increases urinary flow rate and reduces urinary solute concentration
- **Limit dietary oxalate** – avoiding foods that contain high levels of oxalate, such as spinach, potatoes, and some types of nuts (eg, peanuts, cashews, almonds), helps reduce urinary oxalate levels and reduces the risk of calcium oxalate stones
- Limit sodium intake – increases renal sodium and calcium reabsorption, which reduces urinary calcium levels **(Choice A)**
- Reduce animal protein intake – animal protein increases urinary calcium levels and reduces citrate (citrate binds calcium and prevents stones) **(Choice C)**
- **Increase dietary calcium** – calcium binds oxalate in the gastrointestinal system and prevents gastrointestinal oxalate absorption; this reduces the risk of calcium oxalate stones **(Choice E)**
