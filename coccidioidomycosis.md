# coccidioidomycosis

- related: [[ID]]

<!-- coccidioides location, epidemiology, sx, dx, rx -->

This patient has disseminated coccidioidomycosis manifesting as a pulmonary infection. The fungus Coccidioides is inhaled and causes an initial pulmonary infection. In endemic areas, as many as one third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are caused by Coccidioides species. Healthy persons generally contain the initial infection owing to intact cell-mediated immunity; however, immunocompromised persons are at risk for dissemination. This endemic dimorphic fungal infection is known to mimic other diseases, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, and cancer. The patient is stationed in Bakersfield, California, an epicenter for this infection. In addition, his assignment as a car mechanic, with much of his work likely conducted outside, increases the risk of infection. Another clue is his peripheral eosinophilia. A definitive diagnosis generally is made on the basis of serology and histopathologic analysis of tissue. When coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, first-line therapy is fluconazole to prevent progressive or disseminated disease.

_Coccidioides_ is a dimorphic fungus that exists as a mold in the environment. There are two species: _C. immitis_ refers to isolates from California, and _C. posadasii_ refers to isolates from all other endemic areas, including Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. In endemic areas, the annual risk of infection is approximately 3% for most persons, although the risk of infection (and dissemination) is greater in those who are pregnant, younger than 5 years or older than 50 years, or of African, Filipino (and possibly other Asian), and Native American ancestry.

Infection is usually acquired by inhalation of aerosolized arthroconidia. Once inhaled, the fungus begins its dimorphic change in the lungs and becomes a yeast cell. Several clinical syndromes are seen in coccidioidomycosis and may manifest as acute or chronic pulmonary infection, as cutaneous infection (~40%), as meningitis (~33%), or as musculoskeletal infection.

Diagnosis is straightforward in endemic areas and usually is based on clinical manifestations and confirmatory testing by a mycologic culture of affected tissue, histopathologic evaluation of tissue, serology for _Coccidioides_ antibodies, or urinary antigen testing.

Fluconazole is the first-line treatment for symptomatic infection. In patients with meningitis, fluconazole is continued for life. In patients who do not respond to azoles, intrathecal amphotericin B may be an alternative.

A 27-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital for a 1-month history of fever, drenching night sweats, malaise, fatigue, chest pain, and a nonproductive cough. He recently completed a 7-day course of levofloxacin with no improvement in symptoms. The patient is in the military, works as a car mechanic on base, and is stationed in Bakersfield, California.

On physical examination, temperature is 37.8 °C (100.0 °F), blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg, pulse rate is 99/min, respiration rate is 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% with the patient breathing room air. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory studies:

- Hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL
- Leukocyte count: 11,900/µL, with 30% eosinophils, 60% neutrophils, and 10% lymphocytes
- Interferon-γ release assay: Negative

A chest radiograph shows a right lower lobe infiltrate and ipsilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.

Primary pulmonary tuberculosis may present with mid- to lower-zone unilateral infiltrates, unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions. Early in the course of the disease, laboratory findings are often normal; eosinophilia is not present. Finally, pulmonary tuberculosis is excluded by the negative interferon-γ release assay.
