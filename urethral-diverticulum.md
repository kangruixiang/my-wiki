**Urethral diverticulum** typically presents with **dysuria**, postvoid dribbling, **dyspareunia**, and an **anterior vaginal mass**. The diverticulum is a herniation of the urethral mucosa through the muscle wall into the surrounding tissue. Urethral diverticula in women form due to repeated infection, inflammation, and trauma of the urethra from previous pelvic trauma (eg, vaginal delivery) or surgery. Symptoms typically develop due to infection and distension of the diverticulum with purulent fluid. Hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, and stress urinary incontinence are also associated with urethral diverticula. Physical examination typically reveals a tender anterior wall vaginal mass that expresses bloody, purulent fluid on manipulation of the urethra.
