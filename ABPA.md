Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs when patients with either **underlying asthma** or cystic fibrosis become sensitized to _Aspergillus_ antigens, resulting in an intense IgE- and IgG-mediated immune response.  It should be suspected any time a patient with one of these preexisting conditions develops **recurrent exacerbations** with fever, malaise, cough with brownish mucoid sputum, wheezing, or symptoms of bronchial obstruction.

Current diagnostic criteria for ABPA include an **elevated _Aspergillus_-specific IgE** with an elevated (eg, >417 IU/mL) total IgE, positive _Aspergillus_-specific IgG, eosinophilia, and **positive skin test** reactivity for _Aspergillus_.  Consequently, the initial evaluation for ABPA should include either skin testing for _Aspergillus_ or analysis of total and specific IgE concentrations.

Chest radiography typically demonstrates **upper lobe opacities**, atelectasis due to mucus plugging, and signs of **bronchiectasis** such as bronchial wall thickening.  In addition, CT imaging can be helpful to further identify specific radiographic abnormalities consistent with ABPA.

Because allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis represents a hypersensitivity response, systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment (sometimes supplemented by antifungal therapy with an azole).
